## In order to run the Chatbot
First things first our chatbot uses a No-SQL MongoDB database.
### MongoDB install
- Download MongoDB from the official website via this link https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community and select your OS platform
- You can also install MongoDBCompass to view databases from a GUI -> this link https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/compass
#### Linux install (Ubuntu distribution)
```console
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y mongodb-org
```
From now on, we only need to install the Node.JS project dependencies and run it
